# YAP-TAZ-Machine-learning-models
Machine learning models were applied to a cell feature datatset to help predict or classify YAP/TAZ presence.
Models such as a Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbours, Decision Tree and a Random forest were used.
All models were optimised using feature importance and weighting, with graphs made when appropriate.
